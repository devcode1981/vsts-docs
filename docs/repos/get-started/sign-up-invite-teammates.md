# Sign up for free and invite others to collaborate on your project

## Create a project 

If you signed up for Azure DevOps with an existing MSA or GitHub identity, you're automatically prompted to create a project. You can create either a public or private project. To learn more about public projects, see [What is a public project?](../../organizations/public/about-public-projects.md). 

1. Enter a name for your project, select the visibility, and optionally provide a description. Then choose **Create project**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Create a project.](../../boards/get-started/media/sign-up/nf-create-project.png)

	The name can't contain special characters (such as / : \ ~ & % ; @ ' " ? < > | # $ * } { , + = [ ]), can't begin with an underscore, can't begin or end with a period, and must be 64 characters or less. Visibility can be either public or private. With public visibility, anyone on the internet can view your project. With private visibility, only people who you give access to can view your project.
